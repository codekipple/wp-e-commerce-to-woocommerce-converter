# WPEC to Woocommerce converter

A Wordpress plugin to help migrating from WP E-Commerce to Woocommerce.

> USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

> This is a developer's plugin. We recommend that you read the code and only use it on a test version of your site.

## Installation

- Install as any WP plugin (copy to `wp-content/plugins`).

- Make sure Woocommerce plugin is activated.

- Go to `Tools > wpec to woo` and check the numbers

- Click `Convert my store` and watch the magic happen

## What it does

The plugin converts **products**, **categories** and **orders** to Woocommerce. 

Product variations and many shop settings will be lost in the process, it also sets all products tax status to 'taxable' and the tax class to 'standard' regardless.
